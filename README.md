# AMS++

This is a collection of programs written in Motorola 68K assembly\*, C, and TI-BASIC that significantly extend the capabilities of the TI-89 Titanium. Here is a list of the programs in this package and their capabilities:

 * **ccg/ccv:** ~~Generate and play back monochrome animations of graphs~~
 * **clicker:** ~~An interactive recursive function executor~~
 * **grpanner:** An intuitive, aspect ratio-maintaining 2D graph panning/zooming program
 * **rot3d**: A program that interactively moves the 3D graph camera around the graph *only on the Î¸ (theta) angle.* Very useful for "rotating" simple 3D graphs without distortion due to change in camera variables which should remain static.
 * **dord:** Gets the ordinal date of a certain day - i.e., the *n*th day of a year for a given date
 * **idbd:** Gets the number of days between two ISO 8601-formatted dates
 * **padstr:** A convenient, powerful little string utility that pads and truncates strings

They can most likely be ported to other platforms with little effort, however that has not been done yet as the author of most of these programs does not have a TI-92/Voyage 200.
