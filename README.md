# AMS++

This is a collection of programs written in assembly, C, and BASIC that significantly extend the capabilities of the TI-89 Titanium. Here is a list of the programs in this package and their capabilities:

 * **ccg/ccv:** ~~Generate and play back monochrome animations of graphs~~
 * **clicker:** ~~An interactive recursive function executor~~
 * **grpanner:** Implements a more intuitive, aspect ratio-maintaining 2D graph zooming program
 * **idbd:** Gets the number of days between two ISO 8601-formatted dates
 * **padstr:** A convenient, powerful little string utility that pads and truncates strings

They can most likely be ported to other platforms with little effort, however that has not been done yet as the author of most of these programs does not have a TI-92/Voyage 200.
