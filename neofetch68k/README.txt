neofetch68k is a Neofetch clone for TI calculators that run the Advanced
Mathematics Software OS. I've developed this on a TI-89 Titanium and I cannot
guarantee that it will work flawlessly on every other platform such as V200 or
TI-92.

It provides information about the ID # of your calc, the OS version & release
date, the screen resolution, the CPU and its frequency (if applicable),
free/total RAM, free/total Archive space, the number of cycles on the
rechargeable batteries (if applicable), the total number of folders, and the
total number of files/variables.

Due to the unique environment of the TI-68k platform, however, some things are a
little different from what you'd find on a typical Neofetch. There's no mention
of a kernel, installed packages, a shell, a WM, a terminal, nor a DE; however it
does mention how many total folders and variables you have present. Also the
platform logo is a 2bpp bitmap instead of a multicolor ASCII artwork.

Overall this is a great piece of semi-novelty software that provides both form
and function.


I. INSTALLATION

Send neofetch.89p to your calculator. It can be stored anywhere and should be
archived.

Then send the following dependencies from the "_deps" folder:
