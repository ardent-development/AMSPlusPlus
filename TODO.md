# kbdprgms

 - [ ] 1: Draw tickmarks, shading, grayscale, implicit, x= equations
 - [ ] 2: Configure Graph + Styling
   - [ ] user stores x-graphs as x1-99, implicits as imp1-99
 - [X] 3: Round ans(1) - numbers mean # of digits to round to; "A" = 0 digits
   - [X] Hit Enter automatically after paste? (+ Clear)
   - [X] Bottom of the menu can be just good old round(
   - [ ] Handle sigfigs - get entry, figure out # of sigfigs, then round ans to that many digits
 - [ ] 4: "manual" Git-like snapshot manager
 - [X] 5: custom zoom box - aspect ratio maintaining
   - [X] If in 3D mode, make it easy to rotate the graph while not rotating the camera
     - [X] Add a status bar message showing current angle value
     - [X] Let the user type in a different value?
     - [X] Add more exit keys - CLEAR, HOME(also does DispHome)
       - [X] Implemented this for the 2D program as well
   - [ ] For zooming, make the amplification first-priority and move finer controls to the 2nd buttons
 - [X] 6: Quick Insert
   - [X] log(
   - [X] root(
   - [X] string(
   - [X] expr(
   - [X] dim(
   - [X] exact(
   - [X] Archive
   - [X] Unarchiv
   - [X] DelVar
   - [X] If
   - [X] For
   - [X] While
   - [X] Try
   - [X] Then
   - [X] Else
   - [X] End
   - [X] misc\flib("")
 - [ ] 7: Quicksave Text for DeepRCL
 - [ ] 8: DeepRCL (save any text and RCL it quickly, BASIC)
 - [X] 9: misc programs
   - [X] RAM "defragmenter" (manually scrolls through history and then back)
   - [ ] basic dialog-based clock (use Flib for big text)
   - [X] Battery Cycle Tracker w/ datetime - perhaps to a list var? (dim(listname) = # of cycles done)
     - [X] Show current battery level
     - [X] Optimize list appending
     - [ ] Show the raw battery level reading on-dialog

# misc
 - [X] sendkey: press a key from a BASIC program
   - [X] arrow keys + 2nd + diamond
   - [X] F1-F5 + Diamond F1
   - [X] Enter (13), Copy + Paste (24576/16648), Clear (263)
   - [ ] Translate this into a BASIC program with heavy input validation - thanks Zeroko!!
 - [ ] next(num,dir): returns the next (towards +inf) FP representable value of approx(num). If dir < 0, returns the last representable value (towards -inf).
 - [ ] brutesolve: look for FP numbers that make an expression = to 0 (not newton's method!!)
   - [ ] output a list of x smallest evaluations (output) along with their input-vals sorted by size?
 - [ ] brutesum: no matter what, using approximations or not, find the sum of a series
 - [X] hrglass: call before and after executing a program to get the time, in seconds, it takes to execute (in variable `exectime`)
 - [X] CycleGen, the animation software
   - [X] fix undefined maxsteps w/fillmem issue
   - [X] update/modernize (also CycleView and Clicker)
   - [X] update version numbers, reformat comments if necessary
   - [ ] deter APD
 - [X] Clicker: when autocomputing, show iteration # in status bar, and show results on screen
   - [X] improve performance in fastloop in Clicker
   - [X] revise comments, keycode indications
   - [X] Optimize list appending - don't use augment(
 - [ ] pad(str,num,char,rot): pad str to num, rotate by rot
 - [ ] iso8601tools
   - [ ] geti8601(date,time,fmt): convert the date/time to one of the six ISO 8601 formats
     - 0: Ordinal date
     - 1: Date
     - 2: Time
     - 3: Date and time
     - 4: Week
     - 5: Week with weekday
   - [ ] tconv(dt,fmt): convert dt to a different ISO 8601 format, specified by fmt
     - [ ] if fmt has a fractional part = .1, returns the basic format instead of the extended (human-readable version); this cannot be converted back by iso8601tools automatically!
   - [ ] tlen(dt1,dt2): returns the length of time between ISO 8601-formatted dates/times d1 and d2 in seconds
   - [ ] future(dt,forward): returns the date and time stamp of dt incremented by forward seconds.
   - [ ] past(dt,backward): returns the date and time stamp of dt decremented by backward seconds.
   - [ ] dbd(d1,d2): recreation of Finance app's dbd( but works only on days
