 - [ ] 1: Draw tickmarks, shading, grayscale, implicit, x= equations
 - [ ] 2: Configure Graph + Styling
   - [ ] user stores x-graphs as x1-99, implicits as imp1-99
 - [X] 3: Round ans(1) - numbers mean # of digits to round to; "A" = 0 digits
   - [X] Hit Enter automatically after paste? (+ Clear)
   - [X] Bottom of the menu can be just good old round(
 - [ ] 4: "manual" Git-like snapshot manager
 - [X] 5: custom zoom box - aspect ratio maintaining
   - [X] If in 3D mode, make it easy to rotate the graph while not rotating the camera
     - [X] Add a status bar message showing current angle value
     - [X] Let the user type in a different value?
     - [X] Add more exit keys - CLEAR, HOME(also does DispHome)
       - [X] Implemented this for the 2D program as well
   - [ ] For zooming, make the amplification first-priority and move finer controls to the 2nd buttons
 - [X] 6: Quick Insert
   - [X] log(
   - [X] root(
   - [X] string(
   - [X] expr(
   - [X] dim(
   - [X] exact(
   - [X] Archive
   - [X] Unarchiv
   - [X] DelVar
   - [X] If
   - [X] For
   - [X] While
   - [X] Try
   - [X] Then
   - [X] Else
   - [X] End
   - [X] misc\flib("")
 - [ ] 7: Quicksave Text for DeepRCL
 - [ ] 8: DeepRCL (save any text and RCL it quickly, BASIC)
 - [X] 9: misc programs
   - [X] RAM "defragmenter" (manually scrolls through history and then back)
   - [ ] basic dialog-based clock (use Flib for big text)
   - [X] Battery Cycle Tracker w/ datetime - perhaps to a list var? (dim(listname) = # of cycles done)
     - [ ] Show current battery level

# misc
 - [X] sendkey: press a key from a BASIC program
   - [X] arrow keys + 2nd + diamond
   - [X] F1-F5 + Diamond F1
   - [X] Enter (13), Copy + Paste (24576/16648), Clear (263)
   - [ ] Translate this into a BASIC program with heavy input validation - thanks Zeroko!!
 - [ ] brutesolve: look for numbers that make an expression = to 0; not newton's method
   - [ ] output a list of evaluations (output) along with their input-vals sorted by size?
 - [ ] brutesum: no matter what, using approximations or not, find the sum of a series
 - [X] CycleGen, the animation software
   - [X] fix undefined maxsteps w/fillmem issue
   - [X] update/modernize (also CycleView and Clicker)
   - [X] update version numbers, reformat comments if necessary
   - [ ] deter APD
 - [X] Clicker: when autocomputing, show iteration # in status bar, and show results on screen
   - [X] improve performance in fastloop in Clicker
   - [ ] revise comments, keycode indications
   - [ ] in autocompute mode, deter APD
   - [ ] Optimize list appending - don't use augment(
