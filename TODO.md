# kbdprgms

   - [ ] Add support for "(var) = "
   - [ ] Add support for the above but with multiple answers
   - [ ] Handle sigfigs - make submenu that rounds to specific # of sigfigs
     - [ ] Make it work on sci notation
 - [ ] 4: "manual" Git-like snapshot manager
 - [X] 5: custom zoom box - aspect ratio maintaining
   - [X] If in 3D mode, make it easy to rotate the graph while not rotating the camera
     - [X] Add a status bar message showing current angle value
     - [X] Let the user type in a different value?
     - [X] Add more exit keys - CLEAR, HOME(also does DispHome)
       - [X] Implemented this for the 2D program as well
   - [ ] For zooming, make the amplification first-priority and move finer controls to the 2nd buttons
 - [X] 6: Quick Insert
   - [X] log(
   - [X] root(
   - [X] string(
   - [X] expr(
   - [X] dim(
   - [X] exact(
   - [X] Archive
   - [X] Unarchiv
   - [X] DelVar
   - [X] If
   - [X] For
   - [X] While
   - [X] Try
   - [X] Then
   - [X] Else
   - [X] End
   - [X] misc\flib("")
 - [ ] 7: Shortcut to press 2nd + UP, F1, 6, then Home (for use with EQW)
 - [ ] 8: FormulaOne (formula storage and recallation toolbox)
 - [X] 9: misc programs
   - [X] RAM "defragmenter" (manually scrolls through history and then back)
   - [X] Battery Cycle Tracker w/ datetime - perhaps to a list var? (dim(listname) = # of cycles done)
     - [X] Show current battery level
     - [X] Optimize list appending
     - [X] Show the raw battery level reading on-dialog
     - [X] Remove unnecessary intro at the top
   - [X] 68K clock frequency measurement utility
     - [X] make it possible to use it programmatically by setting/getting variables
     - [X] use built in 68K BASIC functions to keep track of time, you fool!!
     - [X] Optimize time-tracking routine locations
     - [X] Delete `automeas` after finishing if auto = true
     - [ ] Remove unnecessary intro at the top - move to a "duration" dialog
       - [ ] Add a way to take a more precise measurement by doing it for longer
   - [ ] Resistor color code -> ohms converter
     - [ ] Vice versa?
   - [ ] Clock with Mandelbrot computation support
     - [ ] Make it look like DCLOCK, but make use of the status line and blank space to display stuff like progress bars
     - [ ] Add timer
       - [ ] add "pause" feature
     - [ ] Figure out the mandelbrot computation part, lmao
     - [ ] Add stopwatch - no background computation; should save list of stops at termination to `stoppnts`

# direct AMS extensions
 - [ ] Custom units

# misc
 - [X] sendkey: press a key from a BASIC program
   - [X] arrow keys + 2nd + diamond
   - [X] F1-F5 + Diamond F1
   - [X] Enter (13), Copy + Paste (24576/16648), Clear (263)
   - [ ] Translate this into a BASIC program with heavy input validation - thanks Zeroko!!
 - [ ] next(num,dir): returns the next (towards +inf) FP representable value of approx(num). If dir < 0, returns the last representable value (towards -inf).
 - [ ] brutesolve: look for FP numbers that make an expression = to 0 (not newton's method!!)
   - [ ] output a list of x smallest evaluations (output) along with their input-vals sorted by size?
 - [ ] brutesum: no matter what, using approximations or not, find the sum of a series
 - [X] CycleGen, the animation software
   - [X] fix undefined maxsteps w/fillmem issue
   - [X] update/modernize (also CycleView and Clicker)
   - [X] update version numbers, reformat comments if necessary
   - [ ] deter APD
 - [X] Clicker: when autocomputing, show iteration # in status bar, and show results on screen
   - [X] improve performance in fastloop in Clicker
   - [X] revise comments, keycode indications
   - [X] Optimize list appending - don't use augment(
   - [ ] Make \[CLEAR\] and \[ESC\] also exit the program
 - [x] padstr(str,chr,n,dir): pad str to num chars with chr, direction changes the "side" to pad to
   - [X] if dim(str) > n, returns original string truncated to n chars from dir?
 - [ ] idbd(d1,d2): recreation of Finance app's dbd( but works only on ISO8601
 - [ ] dord({year,month,day}): get the integer ordinal day of the given date
 - [ ] deor(str): takes str full of "var=(solution) or var=(solution) or var=(solution) ..." and returns a list of the solutions without any mention of var or "or"
