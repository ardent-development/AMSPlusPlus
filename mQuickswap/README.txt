Documentation for mQuickswap is gonna be a little halfassed because of how dead
simple it is.

If you've installed a few of the numerous other programs in this repository, it
is reasonable to assume you have both Flib binaries and statline stored to the
`misc` folder on-calc. If not, get them here:
  Flib: https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/117/11770.html
  statline: https://www.cemetech.net/downloads/files/2600/x3320
These dependencies would be totally unreasonable on their own but considering
this program is part of AMS++, why not do it just for the eye candy. (I also
strongly dislike using Flib for anything status line related as it is so
heinously wasteful for status line tasks.)

Just put "kbdprgm4.89p" on your calc in the `main` folder and ensure it's
accessible via the [DIAMOND]+[4] shortcut. You can remap it if you'd like.

Really simple to use, super self-explanatory UI.
