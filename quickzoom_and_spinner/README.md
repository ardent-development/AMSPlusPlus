# Quickzoom & Spinner

* Quickzoom is a program that draws a box onto your graph screen. You can move it around with the arrow keys and increase/decrease its size with [+] and [-] keys, respectively. See "README_quickzoom.txt" for more info.
* Spinner is a program that lets you rotate any 3D graph in a way that doesn't distort it; i.e., it only rotates the graph left and right. See "README_spinner.txt" for more info.
* Either of these programs are called by a keyboard program depending on the current graphing mode when it's started. This is in "kbdprgm5.89p", and you can remap it to any keyboard program slot you prefer by editing its variable name (not its filename, since that does not affect it).

## Fun fact

Some of Quickzoom was coded on an airplane because I was bored.
