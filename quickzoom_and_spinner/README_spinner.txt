I. INSTALLATION

Send spinner.89p to your calculator. Keep it in any folder and archived.

Then send sendstr.89z and statline.89z from the "_deps" directory. They should
both be in the `misc` folder on-calc, and should be archived since there's no
reason for them not to be.

 * sendstr is a program by Samuel Stearley (sstear70@calvin.edu,
   http://www.geocities.com/sstear70/) that enables BASIC programs to send
   arbitrary strings to input boxes in the OS GUI. It is licensed as "freely
   distributable" as per Samuel. Original licensing statement by Samuel:
    > "This program is freeware so Samuel Stearley is not
      responsible or liable for anything that might
      happen from the use of this program.  Because it is
      a program to enhance basic programs it is freely
      distributable."
 * statline is a public domain C program by me that handles manipulation of the
   status line. https://www.cemetech.net/downloads/files/2600/x3320
