# Standard Program Release Procedure

1. [ ] Finish implementing all planned features for the release.
2. [ ] Assess all dependencies and add them to the distribution folder if not already present.
3. [ ] Thoroughly test **all** features on-calc **and** in a clean environment in an emulator.
4. [ ] Read through the README(s) and fill in any blanks, correct invalid information that may have been previously looked over, and improve clarity. **This is the only step of the process where LLMs may be used: to check if there are any obvious issues in clarity and/or unfilled blanks.**
5. [ ] Take screenshots, if appropriate.
6. [ ] Before submission, check carefully to see if previous screenshot contents are invalidated by changes in the latest planned release.
