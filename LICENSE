Most of this software is under the public domain, mostly the BASIC and C code
that I've written myself.

However, a bunch of the handwritten assembly programs are written by others
and/or have a "complicated" license on them. The directories that contain such
"complicated" programs are (sorted in descending order of grayness of the legal
gray area):

 * sendkey
 * battcycl
