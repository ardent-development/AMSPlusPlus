3rd release.



This allows the user to make kbd programs that paste text to the
entry line.  This will provide quick access to commonly used
functions.

It takes 1 argument and that is the string to send to the entry
line.

For example the following kbd program provides quick access to the
log( function.

kbdprgm1()
Prgm
sendstr("log(")
EndPrgm


There is included another program that will move the cursor left
1 space.  It is called MoveLeft.  So the user can make a kbd
program that moves the cursor between the two parenthesis of the
pasted text.

Example:

kbdprgm1()
Prgm
sendstr("log()")
moveleft()
EndPrgm



And there is also a third program included called clrhm.  It tells
tios that clear has been pressed twice, thereby clearing everything
out of the home entry line.
