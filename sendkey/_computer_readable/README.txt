The first commented line in all the PDFs are malformed due to an issue in
TIEdit's PDF renderer. The original code, when viewed in AMS, is still valid
BASIC.

Also, the entirety of Line 9 in sendkey.pdf is:
Exec "207800C820680338487A000C3F3CFFFE4E905C8F4E7507100000000000000000"&misc\padstr(mathtool\baseconv(k,10,16),"0",4,Â­1)&"0000"
